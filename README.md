# CDPAEW
Here are all the models we used in the paper "Coal dust concentration prediction and early-warning in fully mechanized drivage and fully mechanized stope working faces based on MGformer". If you need raw or test data, send it to lcfqssyx@163.com and we will get back to you with your data request.
